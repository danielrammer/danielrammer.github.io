Most of my early projects in the Ars Electronica Futurelab where about swarm robotics and drone performances. With [SwarmOS](https://ars.electronica.art/futurelab/de/projects-swarm-os/) we build an infrastructure which allowed to operate diverse drone/robot swarms. Combining UAVs and UGVs as well as custom build vehicles and of the shelf drones. We worked on a robot swarm performance, [Stream of Hope](https://ars.electronica.art/futurelab/de/projects-stream-of-hope/), for Tokyo 2020, realized realtime drone light painting and more.
