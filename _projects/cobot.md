CoBot Studio was about exploring which robot signals are most understandable, in which work environments, and for which groups of people.

It was first evaluated in pure VR and later in extended reality with a real robot present in the Deep Space 8K.

As humans and robots collaborate more closely, their shared success depends on certain key factors: How can safe working environments be ensured? How can the acceptance of robots in everyday tasks be increased? And how do you communicate with a colleague that is nothing more than a robotic gripper arm?
