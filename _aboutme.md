Hi, I'm Daniel. I consider myself as a generalist with broad skills in software development and media design. Enjoying working with game engines, 3d modeling tools, producing sound and music and working with all kinds of Adobe products :) .

You can find some of my projects on this website and contact me if you have any questions or ideas.

After several years working primarily in robotics, I decided at 25 to pursue a university degree. During my studies, I unexpectedly developed a strong interest in game development and interactive technologies. This led to numerous game-related side projects and eventually to my role at the Ars Electronica Futurelab. Over the years, Iâ€™ve gained extensive experience in various developer and leadership roles, contributing to diverse and often unconventional research, development, and arts projects.
